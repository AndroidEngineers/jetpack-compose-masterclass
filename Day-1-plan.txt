By the end of Day 1, We should:

Know what a Composable really is (and how it’s different from XML views).

Have a simple mental model of recomposition (not the full runtime yet, just enough).

Be able to use:

@Composable
@Preview
Modifier
Column/Row/Box
Understand state basics:
remember { mutableStateOf(...) }

Why recomposition happens when state changes

Have a project skeleton of Masterly Lite set up:

Packages
Theme
One basic “Timer” screen UI stub
Nav placeholder (even if real Navigation is on Day 4)
